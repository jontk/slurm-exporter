## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-08

### Changed
- Upgraded slurm-client dependency from development version (v0.2.5-dev) to official release v0.3.0 (#39)
  - Validated against live SLURM cluster running API version v0.0.44
  - All integration tests pass with real cluster data (nodes, jobs, partitions)
  - Confirmed rate limiting and adapter pattern functionality
- Re-enabled all disabled collectors after slurm-client API migration
  - All 14 collectors now active and operational

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Fixed duplicate collection per scrape causing 2x API load (#35)
- **Critical**: Fixed user job metrics key mismatch (UserID vs UserName) causing lookup failures (#35)
- Fixed partition metrics using placeholder data instead of real API queries (#35)
  - Idle nodes, down nodes, allocated CPUs/jobs now use actual data
  - Time limits read from partition Maximums/Defaults
- Fixed system collector using simulated values instead of real data (#35)
  - Load averages now read from `/proc/loadavg`
  - Disk usage uses `syscall.Statfs()` for accurate reporting
  - Active controllers queried from SLURM Diagnostics API
  - Config timestamps read from file modification time
- Fixed QoS resource limits extraction to properly parse TRES limits (#35)
- Fixed job memory unit conversion (was off by 1048576x - MB vs bytes) (#35)
- Fixed job NodeCount using actual field instead of hardcoded value (#35)
- Fixed job Account and QoS fields using actual data instead of defaults (#35)
- Fixed node allocation data using real AllocCPUs/AllocMemory instead of estimates (#35)
- Fixed performance collector configuration alignment with registry (#35)
- Fixed health check URL construction for non-default addresses (#35)
- Fixed integration test compilation errors (#37)
  - Corrected slurm-client interface types and API usage
