Description: Prometheus exporter for SLURM workload manager metrics
 SLURM Exporter is a comprehensive Prometheus exporter designed specifically
 for SLURM (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) workload managers.
 It provides detailed metrics about jobs, nodes, partitions, users, accounts,
 fairshare policies, and quality of service (QoS) settings.
 .
 Key features include:
  * Comprehensive SLURM metrics collection covering all cluster aspects
  * Advanced job analytics engine with efficiency monitoring and waste detection
  * High performance with intelligent caching and connection pooling
  * Production-ready security hardening and audit compliance
  * Native Kubernetes and container support with Helm charts
  * Real-time bottleneck analysis and trend reporting
  * Pre-built Grafana dashboards and Prometheus alerting rules
 .
 The exporter connects to the SLURM REST API to collect metrics and exposes
 them in Prometheus format on an HTTP endpoint. It's designed for production
 use in HPC clusters, research computing environments, and large-scale batch
 processing systems.
